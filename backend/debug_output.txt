{'g.title': 'The mechanism of membrane disruption by antimicrobial peptides. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing crisis in modern medicine. Antibacterial peptides from Australian frogs represent a new class of potent and selective antibacterial agents. Understanding how these peptides kill bacteria but not vertebrate cells could lead to the design of new drugs for pharmaceutical and/or clinical purposes.', 'i.name': 'Monash University'}
{'g.title': 'Antibacterial Material Design via Mechanism-Based Mathematical Modelling. This Project aims to provide new rules for the design of novel polymer materials with antibacterial properties by employing mechanism-based mathematical modelling.\nThis Project expects to generate new understanding of those mechanisms which underpin the antibacterial activity of these materials, how bacteria respond to these through metabolic changes and emergence of resistance.These rules will govern material design to yield new antibacterial materials with improved properties.\nExpected outcomes of this project may be a novel mechanism-based mathematical model that will enable the next-generation of antibacterial materials.\nThis outcome will help address the increasing economic and social burden of antibiotic drug resistance in Australia.\n', 'i.name': 'Monash University'}
